    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Darren Jason Watkins Jr.[13] was born on January 21, 2005, in Cincinnati, Ohio.[14] He graduated in 2023 from Ohio Digital Learning School in Maumee.[failed verification][15]

Watkins created his YouTube account in 2016, uploading gameplay videos occasionally.[16] Around December 2017, Watkins began livestreaming and uploading videos of games such as NBA 2K and occasionally Fortnite, averaging two viewers per livestream.[17]</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Watkins became prominent after his fanbase began posting clips on TikTok of his often-violent behavior during live streams towards games, players, and his camera, which gained popularity and became memes. His outbursts have resulted in bans from the streaming platform Twitch and the video game Valorant.[18] Kotaku described Watkins as "one of the biggest and fastest-rising streamers" on YouTube.[16] A game that had contributed to his growth in popularity was Talking Ben. Watkins' videos on Talking Ben the Dog were credited by Lifehacker for bringing the mobile app newfound popularity, with it becoming the best-selling game on the App Store in April 2022, over a decade after its initial release.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">In April 2021, Watkins's YouTube channel reached 100,000 subscribers. Two months later, his channel reached 1 million subscribers.[17] In December 2021, Watkins took part in a Twitch "e-dating" livestream show hosted by Adin Ross. The exchange between Watkins and another participant, Ash Kash, escalated to what was widely interpreted as a rape threat. Watkins was the first contestant to be eliminated, and shortly after the game had ended, he quickly rejoined the Discord call. He started harassing Kash through offensive remarks. Watkins was then kicked out of the call, with Ross apologizing to Kash for his behavior. Watkins was later banned from Twitch for "sexual coercion or intimidation."[20] Watkins' Twitch account would not be unbanned until October 2023, though he would continue to stream on YouTube and would appear on Twitch sporadically on other content creators' streams.[21]</p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">In August 2022, he was swatted while livestreaming on YouTube. Officers handcuffed Watkins, and his cameraman was forced to end the stream.[29] Watkins claimed that he had been placed in jail and that Adin Ross had to bail him out, allowing him to return to streaming on August 11.[30] In September 2022, Watkins played in the Sidemen Charity Match.[31] A clip of him went viral in which he became frustrated at English referee Mark Clattenburg for disallowing his goal to be offside, and in response, Watkins proceeded to whip him with the shirt he removed while celebrating, which resulted in him receiving a yellow card.[32]

In November 2022, Sky Sports announced that they would stop featuring him on their platform after the emergence of past misogynist and derogatory comments made by Watkins. The platform also removed all content featuring Watkins.[33][34] On November 16, he garnered controversy for allegedly doing a 'pump and dump scheme' cryptocurrency scam after he started a livestream promoting The Paradox Metaverse, an action-adventure game awarding players Paradox Coin.[35][36] The next day, he went live to address the controversy and apologized, saying "I do so much stuff for y'all, I made a mistake. I'm not that smart, I'ma be honest, I made a mistake that I wish I never did but I'm not a scammer."[37]

In December 2022, he won the Streamy Award in the "Breakout Streamer" category during the 12th Streamy Awards.[38] That same month, during the round of 16 match between Portugal and Switzerland, Watkins garnered controversy for his behavior toward a Chinese spectator of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, which was interpreted by many as racist. During a live stream, he approached a man wearing an Argentina jersey to question him. Visibly confused, the man specified that he did not speak English, which prompted Watkins to start repeatedly hurling "Konnichiwa", a Japanese greeting, and start uttering sounds reminiscent of Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese. When a clip of the live stream started circulating online, he uploaded an apology video to his Twitter account.[39]</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">On February 23, 2024, Watkins participated in "Match for Hope 2024", a soccer charity match hosted in Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, Qatar, where he played for Team Chunkz.[48] A clip of him went viral in which he slide tackled Brazilian former footballer Kak√°.[49]

Watkins appeared on Night 2 of WWE's WrestleMania XL on April 7, 2024. He was dressed as a bottle of Prime for the WWE United States Championship match between champion Logan Paul, Kevin Owens, and Randy Orton, where he was kicked by Orton and RKOed onto the commentators' table.[50] Watkins would later appear on the April 29 episode of Raw to announce the Raw brand's second-round picks for Night 2 of the 2024 WWE Draft; Paul announced the second round picks for SmackDown.[51]

On May 29, 2024, Watkins attended the annual Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake in Gloucestershire, England, during which he suffered a leg injury, which he claimed required hospitalization.[52] In June and July 2024, during the UEFA Euro 2024, Watkins toured Europe, reaching 25 million subscribers on June 2.[53] On July 3, Watkins visited Norway, where he streamed in a souvenir store. While interacting with a large gathering of fans from a second story window, he injured his ankle. Upon being escorted out by a bodyguard, Watkins was attacked by the crowd,[54] and would be hospitalized.[55] Watkins' tour of Europe received over 2.5 billion views across multiple social media platforms.</p>
